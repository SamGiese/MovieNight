# MovieNight
Can't decide which movie to watch? Let the button decide for you!

This application is coded using C# & .NET Framework & also makes use of the Dapper package to connect to a SQL Server. If you want to run this 
application on your own machine, you will need to restore the .BAK MovieNight file to your SQL Server & then point to code to connect to that. This
is mainly a showcase of my coding knowledge, habits & Etiquette.

Using the application:
Insert any movie name of a movie you want to add to your backlog by typing it into the texbox in the bottom right & hitting insert. You can select the "Show List"
button to view all currently stored movies in the database (It's actually only the top 500). When you can't decide on what movie to watch, click the "Pick Movie" button
& the program will decide for you. If you do decide to watch that movie, you can click the "Remove" button next to it & it will be removed from the database.
